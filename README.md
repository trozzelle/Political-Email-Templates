## Responsive Political Email Templates

This repository is for various political email templates that I build in various frameworks. 



The current content is a generic fundraising email for an example campaign, Johnson for Assembly, that I've challenged myself to recreate. The goal of these files is to create responsive, performant, compatible templates that implement best-practices relevant to political email work.
